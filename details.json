Change the plugin parameters and edit the system events accordingly. The events are to be set up as follows:\nSingle click: returns screen x (number), screen y (number) and button (number: 0 is left, 1 is middle, 2 is right);\nDouble click: returns screen x (number) and screen y (number). Only works for left button.\nButton down: returns screen x (number), screen y (number) and button (number: 0 is left, 1 is middle, 2 is right);\nButton up: returns screen x (number), screen y (number) and button (number: 0 is left, 1 is middle, 2 is right);\nMouse move: returns screen x (number) and screen y (number).\nMouse wheel: returns direction (switch: ON is down, OFF is up). Also works for notebook touchpad.\n\nThe raycaster function returns the map object at a given screen coordinate. To get the object under the cursor, set up a mouse event and call the raycaster function with the returned properties. To get the properties value, they must be set as \"anything\" in the event trigger options.\n\nThis plugin is somewhat complex and was implemented for programmers who have some experience in JS and who know how to properly set event triggers in RPM. If you don't know JS, I recommend you learn it before experimenting with this plugin.
